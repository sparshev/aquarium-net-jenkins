# Contributing

Thanks for choosing to contribute!

The following are a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.

## Code Of Conduct

This project adheres to the Aquarium [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating,
you are expected to uphold this code.

## Have A Question?

Start by filing an issue. The existing committers on this project work to reach
consensus around project direction and issue solutions within issue threads
(when appropriate).

## Code Reviews

All submissions should come in the form of pull requests and need to be reviewed
by project committers. Read [GitHub's pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
for more information on sending pull requests.

Lastly, please follow the [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when
submitting a pull request!

## From Contributor To Committer

We love contributions from our community! If you'd like to go a step beyond contributor
and become a committer with full write access and a say in the project, you must
be invited to the project. The existing committers employ an internal nomination
process that must reach lazy consensus (silence is approval) before invitations
are issued. If you feel you are qualified and want to get more deeply involved,
feel free to reach out to existing committers to have a conversation about that.

## Security Issues

To report a security issue - please mark it with Security label. Auqarium was not designed as
internet-facing service, so it should be protected by the other measures and public reporting of
a security issue should not be a huge problem that endangers users right away.
